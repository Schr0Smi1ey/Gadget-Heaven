## Features

- **Interactive Home Page**: Showcases an attractive banner, categorized sidebar, and gadget cards with product images, names, and prices.
- **Product Details Page**: Each gadget has a dedicated details page with a full description, specifications, availability status, rating, and options to add to the cart or wishlist.
- **Wishlist and Cart System**: Add items to the wishlist and cart, with the cart tab displaying the total price and a sorting feature.
- **Toast Notifications**: Toasts show feedback on adding items to the cart or wishlist, each with distinct messages.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Includes a 404 page, a statistics page with a price vs. product name chart, and dynamic background color on the home page.

## React Fundamentals Used

- **React Hooks**: Implemented with `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useNavigate`.
- **Context API**: Centralized state management for cart and wishlist functions.
- **Routing**: `useNavigate` and `useLocation` from React Router for smooth navigation and route-based actions.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Handled UI elements like the wishlist button disabling, and the cart's Purchase button based on the cart state.

## Core Pages and Components

- **Navbar**: Includes logo, brand name, and links to Dashboard and Stats. The active route is visually indicated.
- **Home Page**: A banner section, gadget category sidebar, and product grid. Clicking categories filters gadgets, and each card has a Details button linking to a detailed view.
- **Product Details Page**: Displays complete information on each product with Add to Cart and Wishlist buttons.
- **Dashboard**: Contains Cart and Wishlist tabs, where users can view added items, sort by price, and manage their selections.
- **About Page**: Briefly describes the website and its purpose.
- **404 Page**: Redirects users when they access a non-existent page.

## Data Management

The Context API is used to manage cart and wishlist data across the app, with optional LocalStorage for data persistence across page reloads.

## Additional Functionalities

- **Persistent Wishlist and Cart**: Once an item is added to the wishlist, its button is disabled to prevent duplicates, even when revisiting the product.
- **Sorting and Filtering**: Users can sort cart items by price and filter products by category on the home page.
- **Statistics Page**: Visual chart showing price vs. product name, with additional data mapped by product rating.
- **Purchase Modal**: When completing a purchase, a modal congratulates the user, empties the cart, and redirects them home.
